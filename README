Django PostgreSQL Netfilters
============================

This project is an attempt at making proper Django net related fields for Django
Currently the built in IPAddressField does not support IPv6 and uses an inefficient
HOST() cast in all lookups. Hopefully there experience from this project can lead
to a resolution of these issues upstream.

In addition to the basic IPAddressField replacement a CIDR and MAC field have
been added. Furthermore a customer Manager allows for access to all of PostgreSQL's
INET operators.
